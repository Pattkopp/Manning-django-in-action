## Sample Code and Exercise Solutions

This is the source code repository that goes along with the _Django In Action_
book. Each chapter in the book adds new features to "RiffMates", a website
for musicians seeking bands and bands seeking musicians.

As Django is a framework, individual code snippets don't tend to work on their
own, they need to operate in the context of a Django project. To help
understand how an example fits into the big picture, this repo contains
multiple copies of the project in incremental stages. For example, the source
code for chapter 3 is split into three directories: `code/ch3a_templates`,
`code/ch3b_inherit`, and `code/ch3c_exercises`. The first two correspond to
the examples on template basics and template inheritance, and the third
contains the answers to the exercises at the end of the chapter.

Electronic copies of the book include Appendix E, a complete listing of
solutions to the exercises. Due to space constraints, printed copies do not
include Appendix E, a PDF version is included in this repository for your
reference.

[_Django In Action_](http://mng.bz/gBqE) is available through the publisher as
well as at your favourite book stores.

If you find errors in the code, feel free to open an issue. For those who
participated in the early access program and internal review process, thanks
so much for your feedback, it made a big difference.
